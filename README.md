# Netflix-like Movie Browser
Being my first-ever coding project back in my Sophomore year of college, it aims to represent a video-streaming service movie library that can be browsed through using Linked Lists in C++.

# How does it work?
In order to test it, there is one main .cpp file where all the methods can be called. In fact, it includes multiple header files:
• category.h: contains the Category node class with different functions used to manipulate movie categories.
• date.h: contains the Date object, which the Movie node uses, and functions for movie date manipulation.
• movie.h: contains the Movie node class, as well as functions for movie manipulation.
